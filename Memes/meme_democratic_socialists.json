  "visual_description": "The meme is divided into three equal horizontal panels. \n\nThe top panel features a diverse group of factory workers and tech developers collaborating in a factory setting filled with machinery and computers. Above them, a large screen displays a bar graph with open-source technology leading, highlighting fair competition in the tech industry. In the background, the backdrop shows an unbranded futuristic city, suggesting a bright future ahead through communal innovation. \n\nThe middle panel shows a historical image of scientists working on the Human Genome Project with a modern twist. Overlaid on this image, a progress bar moves towards completion, symbolizing the ongoing journey of government-driven R&D in AI. Posters on the lab walls say 'Public Goods Not Private Gain,' emphasizing public control over technology.\n\nThe bottom panel shifts to a lush landscape with wind turbines and solar panels, powered by diverse ethnic communities and the tech from the first two panels. In the foreground, diverse groups of people gather with banners reading 'Sustainable AI, Sustainable Future,' as they joyfully cheer, revealing the success of uniting AI with environmental justice.",
