## Superpersuasion Beta

This project allows you to take a white paper and convert it into a political valence of your choice.

The way you use this script is:
`python converter.py input.txt output.txt prompt.txt`

* input.txt defines the white paper to be converted
* output.txt defines the place to output the response
* prompt.txt specifies a text file in the Prompts folder that contains the prompt for political conversion. If not defined, it'll iterate through everything in that folder.

The output summary text will appear in "Outputs"
